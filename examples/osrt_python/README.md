## Introduction 

TIDL provides multiple deployment options with industry defined inference engines as listed below. These inference engines are being referred as Open Source Run Times  in this document.
* **TFLite Runtime**: [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/inference) based inference with heterogeneous execution on cortex-A** + C7x-MMA, using TFlite Delegates [TFLite Delgate](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/performance/delegates) API
* **ONNX RunTime**: [ONNX Runtime]( https://www.onnxruntime.ai/) based inference with heterogeneous execution on cortex-A** + C7x-MMA.
* **TVM/Neo-AI RunTime**: [TVM]( https://tvm.apache.org)/[Neo-AI-DLR]( https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr) based inference with heterogeneous execution on cortex-A** + C7x-MMA


>** *TDA4VM has cortex-A72 as its MPU, refer to the device TRM to know which cortex-A MPU* it contains.

These heterogeneous execution enables:
1. OSRT as the top level inference API for user applications
2. Offloading subgraphs to C7x/MMA for accelerated execution with TIDL
3. Runs optimized code on ARM core for layers that are not supported by TIDL


## OSRT based user work flow 

The diagram below illustrates the TFLite based work flow as an example. ONNX RunTime and TVM/Neo-AI RunTime also follows similar work flow. The User needs to run the model compilation (sub-graph(s) creation and quantization) on PC and the generated artifacts can be used for inference on the device.

## Model Compilation on PC

![OSRT Compile Steps](../../docs/osrt_compile_steps.png)

1. Prepare the Environment for the Model compilation by follwoing the setup section [here](../../README.md#setup)

2. Run for model compilation in the corresponding example folder  â€“ This step generates artifacts needed for inference in the \<repo base>\/model-artifacts folder. Each subgraph is identified in the artifacts using the tensor index of its output in the model	
```
cd examples/osrt_python/flrt
python3 tflrt_delegate.py -c
```
3.	Run Inference on PC	- Optionally user can test the inference in host emulation mode and check the output; the output images will be saved in the corresponding specified artifacts folder
```
python3 tflrt_delegate.py
```
4. Run Inference on PC without offload -  Optionally user can test the inference in host emulation mode without using any delegation to TI Delegate
```
python3 tflrt_delegate.py -d
```


## Model Inference on EVM

The artifacts generated by python scripts in the above section can be inferred using either python or C/C++ APIs. The following steps are for running inference using python API.

![OSRT Run Steps](../../docs/osrt_run_steps.png)

1.	Copy the below folders from PC to the EVM where this repo is cloned
```
./model-artifacts
./models
```
2. Run the inference script in the corresponding example folder on the EVM and check the results, performance etc.
```
cd examples/osrt_python/flrt
python3 tflrt_delegate.py
```

Note : These scripts are only for basic functionally testing and performance check. Accuracy of the models can be benchmarked using the python module released here [edgeai-benchmark](https://git.ti.com/cgit/jacinto-ai/jacinto-ai-benchmark)


## User options

An example call to interpreter from the python interface using delegate mechanism:
    
    interpreter = tflite.Interpreter(model_path='path_to_model', \
                        experimental_delegates=[tflite.load_delegate('libtidl_tfl_delegate.so.1.0', delegate_options)])

'delegate_options' in the interpreter call comprise of the below options (required and optional):

- [^1]: This is not the name of the parameter of the layer but is expected to be the output name of the layer. Note that, if a given layers feature/activations is in 16 bit then parameters will automatically become 16 bit even if its not part of this list  \n- [^2]: Denylist is a string of comma separated numbers which represent the operators as identified in tflite builtin ops. Please refer [Tflite builtin ops](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/r2.3/tensorflow/lite/builtin_ops.h)  , e.g. deny_list = "1, 2" to deny offloading 'AveragePool2d' and 'Concatenation' operators to TIDL. \n
- [^3]: Advanced calibration options can be specified by setting accuracy_level = 9. \n
- [^4]: Note that if for a given layer feature/activations is in 16 bit then parameters will automatically become 16 bit and user need not specify them as part of "advanced_options:params_16bit_names_list". Example format - "conv1_2, fire9/concat_1" \n
